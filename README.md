# TriviaGame

## What the project does
This is an implementation of a trivia game, done as homework for the February 2018 UNC Coding Boot Camp. Its particular focus is on Computer History. Questions are presented with a double dose of nerd and geek humor.

## How to get started with the game
Click the start button and answer the questions. If you beat the countdown timer, click the stop button. When you do that, or time runs out, you'll see how you did.

## Authors
This game was built and will be maintained by Mark Hainline. Help should not be needed, and will not be available.
