# TriviaGame

## What the project does
This is an implementation of a trivia game, done as homework for the February 2018 UNC Coding Boot Camp. Its particular focus is on Computer History. Questions are presented with a double dose of nerd and geek humor.

## How to get started with the game
You can play the game online at GitHub Pages eventually, but it's not yet ready.

## Authors
This game is being built and will be maintained by Mark Hainline. Help should not be needed, and will not be available.
